**About Me**

I'm a basic discord bot, written in Python 3.8 with the Discord.py library.
I'm currently in the early stages of development, so expect new features regularly!

I currently provide several utility/moderation features, as well as entertainment features.

You can invite me to your server [here!](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=788139657711452190&scope=bot)
